Xash3D (pronounced `[ksɑʂ]`) FWGS is a game engine, aimed to provide compatibility with Half-Life Engine and extend it, as well as to give game developers well known workflow.

Xash3D FWGS is a heavily modified fork of an original [Xash3D Engine](https://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine) by Unkle Mike.
